In this project we are using our User Management app [ger-usuario](https://github.com/joaogalvesluiz/ger-usuario) with [APIRestful](https://github.com/joaogalvesluiz/restful)

In client-server we have our client side with HTML, and MVC to controll all actions made by user,
and in restful we are connecting to our NeDB to create,save, edit or delete the registers.
